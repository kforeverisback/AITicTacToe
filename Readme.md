## Automated AI Tic-Tac-Toe Evaluation

This project evaluates two types of searching heuristics namely MinMax and Alpha-Beta search, which is used widely in Artificial Intelligence and Heuristics Searching.

Also this project can generate graph nodes as images as it runs so that it is easier for students to visualize what is happening when the search algorithm is applying the heuristics.

## Usage: 
Both codeblocks and Visual Studio 2017 solution is included.
Building is straightforward. No other libraries are used.

Build->Then Run the executable and follow the instructions.
